1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 5, 11, 8, 13, 13, 17â€¦.. This series is a mixture of 2 series fail the odd terms in this series form a Fibonacci series and all the even terms are the prime numbers in ascending order
Write a program to find the Nth term in this series

Explanation:
when N:14, the 14th term in the series is 17 So only the value 17 should be printed

Input Description"
A single integer denotes the Nth term 

output descriptio
A single integer denotes the value of Nth term
