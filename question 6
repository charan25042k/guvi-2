problem statement 
This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous  term using the formula (x/2)
0,0,2,1,4,2,6,3,8,4,10,5,12,6,14,7,16,8... You have to find the value of  Nth positive integer 

Explanation :
if n=10,the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the series. The 9th term is 8 so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed

Input Description"
A single integer denotes a Nth term 
Output Description
A single integer denotes the valuse of Nth term 

Test case 1
input -10
output - 4 

Test case 2
input -1000
output - 499

Test case 3
input -2000
output - 999

Test case 4
input -20
output - 24 

Test case 5
input -250
output - 124 


program in python
n = int(input('enter the number:'))

a=0
b=0

for i in range(1,n+1):
    if(i%2!=0):
        a= a+2
    else:
        b= b+1

if(n%2!=0):
    print('{}'.format(a-2))
else:
    print('{}'.format(b-1))
