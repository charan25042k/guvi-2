Problem Statement
One programming language has the following keywords that cannot be used as identifiers:break, case, continue, default, defer, else, for, func, goto, if, map, range, return, struct, type, var
Write a program to find if the given word is a keyword or not

input description:
The first line contail string as input 
output description:
Print key word if the given string is keyword otherwise print not key word 

Explanation :
for test case 1 defer is the input string. The defer is keyword so the output is keyword 

Case 1
Input – defer
Output – defer is a keyword
Case 2
Input – While
Output – while is not a keyword

Case 3
Input – case
 Output – case  is a keyword
Case 4
Input – print 
Output – print  is not a keyword
Case 5
Input –  else 
Output – else   is a keyword

program 
python  
keyword = {"break", "case", "continue", "default", "defer", "else", "for", 
"func", "goto", "if", "map", "range", "return", "struct", "type", "var"}

input_var = input()
if input_var in keyword:
    print(input_var+ " is a keyword")
else:
    print(input_var+ " is a not keyword")
