problem statement 
Ravi is very well in addition and substraction.His teacher given a big number . he want to find the difference between the sum of odd and even numbers in the big number .

explanation :
Odd positions are 4 and 6 as they are pos: 1 and pos: 3, both have sum 10. Similarly, 5 and 7 are at even positions pos: 2 and pos: 4 with sum 12. Thus, difference is 12 â€“ 10 = 2

Input description:
A single integer N denotes the big number 
Output description 
A single integer denotes the difference

Output: 9


program 
num = [int(d) for d in str(input("Enter the number:"))]
even,odd = 0,0
for i in range(0,len(num)):
    if i % 2 ==0:
        even = even + num[i]
    else:
        odd = odd + num[i]

print(abs(odd-even))num = [int(d) for d in str(input("Enter the number:"))]
even,odd = 0,0
for i in range(0,len(num)):
    if i % 2 ==0:
        even = even + num[i]
    else:
        odd = odd + num[i]

print(abs(odd-even))
